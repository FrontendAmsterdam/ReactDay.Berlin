<p>Our organization is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.</p>
<p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.</p>
<p>Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
<h3>The Long Version</h3>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

But there is a problem. The final version of the product does not exist. As there is no final iPhone.

Product teams work daily on product. But design layouts and components in the code live in different worlds, they need to be updated manually.

How to continuously deliver design changes to the react design system?

You build narratives, characters and plots — but you aren’t writing a novel, you’re writing components. I came to engineering from the world of creative writing and what surprised me the most is how similar code is to fiction. React itself follows tenants of creative writing and when you lean into those rules, you create solid component architecture.

The only perception you can feel is as hot as a hell metal case of the laptop. Although this sounds like a horror movie, this is your application that cannot leverage modern APIs to lift heavy computation to a different thread where consequently user suffers the pain.

Modern features like Web Workers, WebAssembly, Worklets, and Service Worker allow us to leverage multithreading computing to run tasks parallely which at the end, makes the user feel like in a rainbow paradise instead of a nightmare, even though  JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language! 

In this session, I am going to show my experience running jobs in parallel on a React.Js application that will provide a pleasant user experience and exciting development. ",

In this talk, I will share some of the useful techniques I’ve learned about customizing data visualizations for a global audience. With a focus on React and high level ideas to keep in mind when designing, coding, testing, internationalizing, and localizing data visualizations for the world!",

In the second half of the workshop, we’ll connect our GraphQL server to a React application with Apollo Client. We’ll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to set everything up and use queries and mutations. We’ll show a few different approaches for working with Apollo: Higher Order Components, Render Props, and hooks.

Writing good code that is easy to test requires a good understanding of programming principles and how they apply to the libraries of choice. Discussing principles is harder than discussing tools.
